               DEFAULT SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL C/C++ CONSOLE COMPILES
               =================================================

    This folder provides a structure for building and executing the
    VCShowsDef.c program.  Basic options are used for compiling a
    Release build comparable to what is accomplished with a basic
    Visual Studio compilation.  The idea is to provide the command-
    line counterpart of the ShowDefs\VS2013\Default compilation.

    The result can be demonstrated by extracting DefaultProject.zip,
    making any necessary script adjustments, and then using the
    DefaultBuild.bat script to compile and the DefaultRun.bat to
    execute the result of a successful compile.

    *** IMPORTANT ***
        The DefaultBuild.bat and DefaultRun.bat are designed to be
        used in their locations in VC\Default\ and VC\DefaultDefaultProject\
        respectively.
         * DefaultBuild.bat depends on VC\VCbind.bat being in that
           location and its prerequisites being satisfied there.
         * DefaultRun depends on DefaultProject.zip being extracted
           into Default\DefaultProject\.
         * DefaultBuild depends on being able to locate ShowDefs\src\ from
           ShowDefs\VC\Default\DefaultProject\
         * DefaultRun depends on there being a successful compile with result
           Default\DefaultProject\Release\Default.exe

    The purpose is to provide command-line compilation that can be used
    whether or not the Visual Studio IDE is used.  This and its cousins
    are intended to demonstrate customizations that can be used for similar
    purpose in other C/C++ projects targeted to the Windows platform.

MANIFEST

    Default.txt
        This manifest, summary, and job jar.

    .gitignore
        Exclusion of DefaultProject/ from the source tree

    DefaultBuild.bat
        Windows batch command script that is useful for compiling a
        Default.exe

    DefaultRun.bat
        Windows batch command script that is useful for executing the
        compiled Default.exe.

    DefaultProject.txt
        Manifest, summary and job jar for DefaultProject.zip, describing
        how to extract and use Default\DefaultProject\ for demonstrating
        Default.exe compilation and execution.

    DefaultProject.zip
        Zip Archive containing the scripts and associated data that can
        be extracted in place for compiling a Default.exe that presents
        default pre-processor labels that are defined (or not) in the
        compilation

    DefaultProject/
        This is a working folder in which the script files are extracted and
        used.  The working folder is not part of the Git Source Tree and its
        contents will not be preserved in the source-code control system. If
        the folder does not exist, it will be created when DefaultProject.zip
        is extracted.  Any local adaptations can be made there and kept out of
        the DefaultProject.zip file.

TODO

 * Spiff up VC.txt with material and narrative best centralized there and
   only redundant if at this level.

 * Set up DefaultProject.zip and DefaultProject.txt scripts at this level.

 * Do the Default\DefaultProject level to get compiles and executions
   working.

 * Explain the %1 parameter on DefaultBuild.bat and also on VCbind.bat.

 * In a production project, the Build.bat and the use of a Visual Studio
   solution might co-exist.  It is tempting to merge the two *Project.zip
   packages.  Yet another case is merging with a kind of makefile project.
   I think it is wiser to keep them separate here, and think hard about
   the difficulty of maintenance in applying these techniques in a serious
   open-source activity.

 * There needs to be something somewhere about the testing of these scripts
   both for regression checking and also for testing modified or customized
   scripts.  The checklist might be at a higher level, and it should be
   located from the scripts here.  This applies to VS2013\ examples as well.

 * Verify whether Default.exe runs on Windows versions from Windows XP to
   Windows 10 Technical Preview.

 * Verify that the scripts work properly when portions of the source tree
   are cloned to a different computer location than in the source tree itself.

 * Determine what the difference with down-level versions of VC compilers
   when pre-2013 versions of Visual Studio or the Platform SDK are used.

 * Determine what different up-level Visual Studio releases do when the
   compilers provided with post-2013 version of Visual Studio or the
   Platform SDK are used.

 * Provide a DefaultTest.bat that runs DefaultRun.bat and captures the result
   in a temporary location and compares it with DefaultRun.txt, the result
   obtained by the author following the instructions.  Since there are time-
   stamp differences in separate runs, those much be accounted for somehow.

 * Define precisely how DefaultProject.zip is to be extracted, with creation
   of a DefaultProject/ folder holding the extracted files.

 * Address the options options that are set for these compiles and how they
   reflect the VS2013 counterpart compilations.  This is also not strictly a
   default compilation, it is one with some preferences, but default behavior
   with respect to the language that is compiled and what the target is.

 * Capture enough information about the settings made here so that one can
   detect any difference when Platform SDK 8.1 is installed in addition to
   the basic Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.

 * Update the ShowDefs\VS2013\Default\Default.txt to reflect any improvements
   here that can be transposed back to that file.
