               SHOW DEFAULT DEFINITIONS IN VISUAL C COMPILES
               =============================================

    This DefaultProject.zip contains a BuildRun.bat script for building the
    VCShowDefs.c program.  The VC default settings are used for making a
    Release build.  There are no other compilation setting about the language
    being compiled beyond choosing to build a release with static binding of
    the run-time library.  There are some convenience settings used by the
    author that do not impact the code compiled.

    The result can be demonstrated by extracting the project, building the
    program, and executing the ShowDefs\VC\Default\DefaultRun.bat script
    there or the DefaultRun.bat script in the extracted project.
