               BINDINGS FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE COMPILES
               ===============================================

    VCbind.zip contains Windows batch scripts for binding to the developer
    environment used for compiling with the Visual Studio C/C++ command-
    line compiler, cl.exe, and exercise of related Microsoft developer tools.

    The scripts do not perform compilation.  They setup the command-line
    environment so that the compiler and all related Microsoft tools can be
    used.  This includes setting the command-line PATH for finding the
    compiler and companion development tools.  Environment variables are
    set up for use by the tools, including where to search for C/C++ #include
    files and search for .lib files for linking into compiled code.


MANIFEST

    VCbind.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.

    VCbind.bat
        Script that, when run, will locate Visual Studio settings and perform
        an appropriate setup of the environment for operating with the latest
        installed version of the Visual C++ compiler and accompanying tools.
        Other scripts in ShowDefs\VC\ expect to find this script or a custom
        version at VC\VCbind\VCbind.bat relative to their own location under
        VC\.

TODO

 * Switch to using a dev/WinCon Construction set stucture for compiling this
   project.  There will be other refactoring as well.
   
 * The arrangement should be simpler because much of the verbiage and 
   developer cases can be deferred to the nfoTools development and the
   nfoWare pages on WinConKits.  

 * We need some images and related documentation here where it is common to
   all of the cases in this folder.
