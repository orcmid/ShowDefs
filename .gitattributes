#           GIT ATTRIBUTES FOR THE SHOWDEFS GIT REPOSITORY

# Set the default behavior in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
# This will automatically convert between line-ending style of the client
# and whatever line-ending style that is found in the repository.  (On the
# client, always use a Git package that is compiled for the native OS.)

* text=auto
# This declares files to be text by default and to be line-ending alterable.
# Be careful.  See the group below.

# Denote all files that are truly binary and must not be scanned for line-end.
# Some of these might also be .gitignored.  Better safe than sorry.
