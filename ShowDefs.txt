             SHOWDEFS C/C++ PRE-PROCESSOR DEFINITIONS AND SETTINGS
             =====================================================

    This is the GitHub project for orcmid/ShowDefs.  The project provides
    demonstration of a method for reporting the pre-processor definitions
    that apply in a given C/C++ compilation.  The information is useful
    in providing portable source-code build setups.  Demonstrations are
    provided for the building of portable projects using Microsoft
    Windows development tools, including Visual Studio projects and VC++
    command-line projects.

    Every subfolder in this project has a *.txt file with the same name
    as the subfolder, where additional structure, practices, and work
    items are accounted for.

TODO

 * Add VC++/ and VC++.txt for the command-line adaptation, using batch files
   to allow the VC++ tools to be used from within POSIX shells.  This should
   all run and build from under the MSYS2 shell.

 * Add WinGCC for the command-line adaptation using the version of GCC that
   installs with MSYS2 Dev Tools as a way to compile for Native Windows using
   GCC command-line usage.

 * Do something better with the README.md beyond the default that was created
   when the repository was initialized by GitHub.

 * Include NOTICE if and when needed.

 * Add VS2015/ using the initial Technology Preview and track until the
   release version.  This will provide some Windows 10 Technical Preview
   tracking as well.

1.24 2014-12-05-21:31 Expand Project Content
     .gitignore is accounted for along with the VS2013/ folder for exploring
     pre-processor variables that are set when including various VS2013 C/C++
     projects.  Add license claim.
1.23 2014-12-04-13:34 Provide Initial Manifest
     Don't duplicate what is in the README.  But use this to have versioning
     on the package and have some history that works when the code is down-
     loaded in a package and not as a Git repository.  The LICENSE and
     README.md are added.  Add src/ here and start with src.txt there too.
1.22 2014-12-04-10:41 Create placeholder to "prime the pump" as kicking off
     GitHub orcmid/ShowDefs.  This is 1.22 in order to synchronize with the
     older history of the file that was started in 2005.
