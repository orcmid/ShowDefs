             SHOWDEFS C/C++ PRE-PROCESSOR DEFINITIONS AND SETTINGS
             =====================================================

    These are the GitHub sources for orcmid/ShowDefs.  The project demon-
    strates a method for reporting pre-processor definitions employed for
    given C/C++ compilation settings.  The information is useful in
    establishing repeatable source-code build setups.  Illustration is
    with techniques for building Windows versions of cross-platform
    software using Microsoft development tools, including Visual Studio
    Projects and VC++ command-line compilations.  Alternative tool chains
    are usable along-side the provisions for use of Microsoft development
    tools.

    Note: This repository is intended to be usable when cloned to a Microsoft
    platform.  The notation for file paths reflects that, even though POSIX
    path notation is used in the git and when viewed on GitHub.


MANIFEST

    ShowDefs.txt
        This summary, manifest and work-item file for the top level of the
        orcmid/ShowDefs code tree.

    .gitignore
        Rules for files that are excluded from the repository.  This is
        used to exclude ephemeral materials of projects and builds,
        including final executables and libraries that are not delivered
        in the code tree.  VS Solution and Project files are also excluded
        because working copies may change in ways that should not pollute
        the archived forms.  See the VS2013\ folder for how this is avoided.

    LICENSE
        The Apache License, Version 2.0, plaintext form

    README.md
        The GitHub MarkDown text form use as the presented page
        of the project at <https://githug.com/orcmid/ShowDefs>

    docs\
        folder for documentation of ShowDefs and the approach for simple
        projects on Windows that target the Microsoft platform

    src\
        folder of common source used across the various configurations

    testing\
        folder for how the components of the ShowDefs project are tested,
        especially the various scripts, with guidance on how customizations
        of the technique can also be tested.

    VC\
        folder for builds using the Visual Studio VC compiler from the
        command line in console sessions instead of from within Visual Studio.

    VS2103\
        folder for builds using pre-defined Visual Studio 2103 Solution
        and Project files for those

TODO

 * Add VC\ for the command-line adaptation, using batch files to allow
   the VC++ tools to be used from within POSIX shells.  This should
   all run and build from under the MSYS2 shell as well as cmd.exe, Power-
   shell, TakeComand, etc.

 * Add a testing.txt or maybe a testing folder?  The folder allows for
   multiple testing cases housed in one place.  This is different than
   tests on builds.  It is about the scripts and such here.

 * Add a docs\ folder to provide a consolidation point for repetitive
   information, also providing more about using this repository and
   adapting the techniques it demonstrates.

 * Emphasize that ShowDefs and the illustrative procedures that it gives us
   examples for is all about building for Windows on Windows, relying on
   Microsoft tools for that purpose, starting with cmd.exe and then the
   developer tools.

 * Add WinGCC for the command-line adaptation using the version of GCC that
   installs with MSYS2 Dev Tools as a way to compile for Native Windows using
   GCC command-line usage.

 * Add Clang for the command-line adaption as well and for how it will be
   usable from within Visual Studio 2015.

 * Do something better with the README.md beyond the default that was created
   when the repository was initialized by GitHub.

 * Include NOTICE if and when needed.

 1.28 2014-12-27-07:43 Add VC\, testing\, and docs\
      The text and work items are cleaned up and three additional sub-
      directories accounted for.
 1.27 2014-12-08-09:00 Complete License Notices
      The license notices have been placed on src/ and VS2013/ content
 1.26 2014-12-07-14:07 New Work Items
      Pondering the naming of src/
 1.25 2014-12-06-08:37 Improve Summary
      The summary is refined with the motivation for how Microsoft tooling is
      supported alongside or part of the use of other tool chains, along with
      other touch-ups.
 1.24 2014-12-05-21:31 Expand Project Content
      .gitignore is accounted for along with the VS2013/ folder for exploring
      pre-processor variables that are set when including various VS2013 C/C++
      projects.  Add license claim.
 1.23 2014-12-04-13:34 Provide Initial Manifest
      Don't duplicate what is in the README.  But use this to have versioning
      on the package and have some history that works when the code is down-
      loaded in a package and not as a Git repository.  The LICENSE and
      README.md are added.  Add src/ here and start with src.txt there too.
 1.22 2014-12-04-10:41 Create placeholder to "prime the pump" as kicking off
      GitHub orcmid/ShowDefs.  This is 1.22 in order to synchronize with the
      older history of the file that was started in 2005.
