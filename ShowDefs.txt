             SHOWDEFS C/C++ PRE-PROCESSOR DEFINITIONS AND SETTINGS
             =====================================================

    These are the GitHub sources for orcmid/ShowDefs.  The project demon-
    strates a method for reporting pre-processor definitions employed for
    given C/C++ compilation settings.  The information is useful in
    establishing repeatable source-code build setups.  Illustration is
    with techniques for building Windows versions of cross-platform
    software using Microsoft development tools, including Visual Studio
    Projects and VC++ command-line compilations.  Alternative tool chains
    are usable along-side the provisions for use of Microsoft development
    tools.


MANIFEST

    ShowDefs.txt
        This summary, manifest and work-item file for the top level of the
        orcmid/ShowDefs code tree.

    .gitignore
        Rules for files that are excluded from the repository.  This is
        used to exclude ephemeral materials of projects and builds,
        including final executables and libraries that are not delivered
        in the code tree.  VS Solution and Project files are also excluded
        because working copies may change in ways that should not pollute
        the archived forms.  See the VS2013/ folder for how this is avoided.

    LICENSE
        The Apache License, Version 2.0, plaintext form

    README.md
        The GitHub MarkDown text form use as the presented page
        of the project at <https://githug.com/orcmid/ShowDefs>

    src/
        folder of common source used across the various configurations

    VS2103/
        folder for builds using pre-defined Visual Studio 2103 Solution
        and Project files for those

TODO

 * Add VC++/ and VC++.txt for the command-line adaptation, using batch files
   to allow the VC++ tools to be used from within POSIX shells.  This should
   all run and build from under the MSYS2 shell as well as cmd.exe, Power-
   shell, TakeComand, etc.

 * Add WinGCC for the command-line adaptation using the version of GCC that
   installs with MSYS2 Dev Tools as a way to compile for Native Windows using
   GCC command-line usage.

 * Do something better with the README.md beyond the default that was created
   when the repository was initialized by GitHub.

 * Include NOTICE if and when needed.

 * Add VS2015/ using the initial Technology Preview and track until the
   release version.  This will provide some Windows 10 Technical Preview
   tracking as well.

 * Percolate the ALv2 Notice down through the folders and into scripts.
   (Can't close this until it is at least percolated down into all
   subordinate folders.)

 * Rename src/ to common/ because there could well be shim code at one of
   the configuration-dependent subprojects.  Or maybe by the source code?
   That would maybe make common/c, common/cs, common/java, that sort of thing?
   I have to be careful about the path names that will then be involved.

1.26 2014-12-07-14:07 New Work Items
     Pondering the naming of src/
1.25 2014-12-06-08:37 Improve Summary
     The summary is refined with the motivation for how Microsoft tooling is
     supported alongside or part of the use of other tool chains, along with
     other touch-ups.
1.24 2014-12-05-21:31 Expand Project Content
     .gitignore is accounted for along with the VS2013/ folder for exploring
     pre-processor variables that are set when including various VS2013 C/C++
     projects.  Add license claim.
1.23 2014-12-04-13:34 Provide Initial Manifest
     Don't duplicate what is in the README.  But use this to have versioning
     on the package and have some history that works when the code is down-
     loaded in a package and not as a Git repository.  The LICENSE and
     README.md are added.  Add src/ here and start with src.txt there too.
1.22 2014-12-04-10:41 Create placeholder to "prime the pump" as kicking off
     GitHub orcmid/ShowDefs.  This is 1.22 in order to synchronize with the
     older history of the file that was started in 2005.
