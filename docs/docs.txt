    the source code tree, its maintenance, usage prerequisites, and usage in
    incorporating the techniques in other projects beyond the simple example
    cases with ShowDefs.c.

TODO

 * Add material to the docs folder.

 * Connect to testing, which is somewhat about maintenance too.

 * Explain prerequisites and how to obtain them.

 * There may be many references to external resources.  Need to figure out
   how to organize that.

 * See if MarkDown is appropriate and what happens on GitHub when MarkDown
   files are viewed in the code browser.
