          SHOW DEFAULT DEFINITIONS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
          =======================================================

    DefaultProject.zip contains a Visual Studio 2013 Project for building the
    VCShowDefs.c program.  The VS2013 default settings are used for making a
    Release build.  There are no other compilation setting beyond choosing to
    build a release.  There are some convenience settings used by the author,
    but they do not impact compilation.

    The result can be demonstrated by extracting the project, building the
    program, and executing the ShowDefs/VS2013/Default/DefaultRun.bat script.
