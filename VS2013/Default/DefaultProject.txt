          SHOW DEFAULT DEFINITIONS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
          =======================================================

    DefaultProject.zip contains a Visual Studio 2013 Project for building the
    VCShowDefs.c program.  The VS2013 default settings are used for making a
    Release build.  There are no other compilation setting about the language
    being compiled beyond choosing to build a release with static binding of
    the run-time library.  There are some convenience settings used by the
    author that do not impact the code compiled.

    The result can be demonstrated by extracting the project, building the
    program, and executing the ShowDefs/VS2013/Default/DefaultRun.bat script
    or the DefaultRun.bat that is part of this package.

 0.04 2014-12-14-16:08 Simplify DefaultRun.bat Usage
      The script is modified so it can be executed without having to make
      its location (%~dp0) the current directory.
 0.03 2014-12-11-14:40 Update Solution and Archive
      The configuration options are set to not produce a PDB file
      so that VS2015 Preview does not complain about lack of PDB in the MT
      static library.  Default.vcproj.user is also preserved as a precaution.
 0.02 2014-12-10-16:21 Reflect modified source file and use of static linking
      of the run-time library into Default.exe.
 0.01 2014-12-08-17:25 Add DefaultRun.bat
      Incorporate a version designed to operate in the extracted folder.
      This one is outside of the source tree and freely modifiable.
 0.00 2014-12-07-18:51 Initial draft for the Default VS Project case.
