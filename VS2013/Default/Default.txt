                DEFAULT SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
                ===============================================

    This folder provides a Visual Studio 2013 Project for building the
    VCShowsDef.c program.  The default settings are used for making a
    Release compilation.  No other VS 2013 settings or options are
    exercises.

    The result can be demonstrated by extracting the project, building the
    program, and executing the program using the DefaultProject.bat script.

    *** IMPORTANT ***
        The VS2013 Project and DefaultRun.bat are designed to be operated
        from their working locations in this code tree.
         * DefaultRun.bat depends on DefaultProject.zip being extracted
           into subfolder DefaultProject/ of this folder.
         * The Project depends on being able to locate src\VCshowDefs.c from
           DefaultProject\
         * DefaultRun.bat depends on the the Project being successfully built
           with the executable DefaultProject\Release\Default.exe in result.

MANIFEST

    Default.txt
        This manifest, summary, and job jar.

    .gitignore
        Exclusion of DefaultProject/ from the source tree

    DefaultRun.bat
        Windows batch command script that is useful for executing the
        compiled result produced by the Default Project.

    DefaultProject.txt
        Manifest, summary and and job jar for DefaultProject.zip, describing
        how to extract and use the Visual Studio Solution and Project for the
        Default demonstration.

    DefaultProject.zip
        Zip Archive containing the Visual Studio Solution and Project that
        can be extracted in place for compiling a demonstration Default.exe
        showing default pre-processor labels that are defined (or not) in
        the compilation

    DefaultProject/
        This is a working folder in which the project files are extracted and
        used.  The working folder is not part of the Git Source Tree and its
        contents will not be preserved in the source-code control system. If
        the folder does not exist, it will be created when DefaultProject.zip
        is extracted.  Any local adaptations can be made there and kept out of
        the DefaultProject.zip file.

TODO

 * Verify that the Default.exe runs on Windows versions from Windows XP to
   Windows 10 Technical Preview.  (It appears that it can't load on XP.)

 * Verify that the VS Solution and Project work when the repository is cloned
   to a different computer location than the clone in which it was created.
   DONE 2014-12-09.

 * Determine what down-level Visual Studio releases do with the VS 2013
   Solution and Project here.

 * Determine what different up-level Visual Studio releases do with the
   VS 2013 Solution and Project here, created by VS Express 2013 for Windows.
   DONE 2014-12-09: Other VS 2013 versions simply use the project.  VS 2015
   Preview will update the Solution and Project information in a benign way.

 * Verify that Default.exe will not operate on Windows XP and see if we can
   determine exactly why.

 * Provide a DefaultTest.bat that runs DefaultRun.bat and captures the result
   in a temporary location and compares it with DefaultRun.txt, the result
   obtained by the author following the instructions.  Since there are time-
   stamp differences in separate runs, those much be accounted for somehow.

 * Define precisely how DefaultProject.zip is to be extracted, with creation
   of a DefaultProject/ folder holding the extracted files.

 * Include the dependency caveats in DefaultProject.zip as well.

 * I think it would be useful to have DefaultRun.bat in both places.  I think
   it would be better to have it in one place.  An alternative might be to
   have a simple relay, except that would fail if DefaultProject.zip has not
   been expanded.  So it can't be that simple.  Also, it may be valuable
   to keep DefaultRun.bat here in case the one in DefaultProject\ is mangled.

 * Document the specific VS 2013 options that are set for these compiles.
   This is not strictly a default compilation in that respect, it is one
   with some preferences, but default behavior with respect to the language
   that is compiled.

 * Update to use build with static library and see how that works up-/down-
   level and whether that makes things work on Windows XP.

 * Try signing the Default.exe (extra credit) after getting command-line
   compiles working so we have vcvars.bat figured out before installing
   SDK 8.1.

 * Fix DefaultRun.bat to work with %~dp0 and verify that the location is
   correct.

 * Fix the DefaultRun.bat in DefaultProject.zip to work accordingly.

 1.28 2014-12-15-18:34 Revise Batch Files
      The DefaultRun batch files are modified to use their own locations
      and access the related material even when executed from a different
      current shell directory.
 1.27 2014-12-11-14:26 Eliminate PDB Warnings
      The Project Configuration is modified to not produce debugging infor-
      mation so that the lack of PDB information for parts of the MT static
      library will not create a blizzard of warning messages with VS2015.
 1.26 2014-12-10-16:09 Correction to use Static Libraries and not have any
      CRT DLL dependencies.  Add more work items and thinking out-loud.
 1.25 2014-12-08-17:29 Complete DefaultRun.bat Testing
      DefaultRun.bat is verified and DefaultProject.zip is updated to include
      a modifiable version for use with the extracted, modifiable material.
 1.24 2014-12-08-09:00 Provide Initial DefaultRun.bat
 1.23 2014-12-07-18:36 Restructure Extraction
      DefaultProject.zip is structured to depend on extraction into sub-
      folder DefaultProject/ and documented accordingly.
 1.22 2014-12-04-18:02 Initial draft for the Default VS Project case.
