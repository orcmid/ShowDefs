                DEFAULT SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
                ===============================================

    This folder provides a Visual Studio 2013 Project for building the
    VCShowsDef.c program.  The default settings are used for making a
    Release compilation.  No other VS 2013 settings or options are
    exercises.

    The result can be demonstrated by running the

VS2013 VERSIONS
    Free versions of Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 are all that are required
    to employ the VS2013 Projects included in ShowDefs.  The VS Projects were
    all produced using Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop.  They have been
    tested using Visual Studio Community 2013 as well.


MANIFEST

    Default.txt
        This manifest, summary, and job jar.

    DefaultProject.bat
        Windows batch command script that is useful for executing the
        compiled result produced by the Default Project.

    DefaultProject.txt
        Manifest, summary and and job jar for DefaultProject.zip, describing
        how to extract and use the Visual Studio Solution and Project for the
        Default demonstration.

    DefaultProject.zip
        Zip Archive containing the Visual Studio Solution and Project that
        can be extracted in place for compiling a demonstration Default.exe
        showing default pre-processor labels that are defined (or not) in
        the compilation

    *.* Other files
        When the content of DefaultProject.zip is extracted in place, there
        will be additional files that are used by Visual Studio and others
        that are produced by the compilation process.  Those files are not
        under source control and need not be preserved here.

TODO

 * Confirm that DefaultProject.txt being the same in DefaultProject.zip
   will not produce an "uncommitted change" when extracted from the
   DefaultProject.zip archive.

 * Add DefaultProject.bat for verifying that a build has occured and then
   execute the resulting Default.exe program.

 * Verify that the Default.exe runs on Windows versions from Windows XP to
   Windows 10 Technical Preview.

 * Verify that the VS Solution and Project work when the repository is cloned
   to a different computer location than the clone in which it was created.

 * Determine what down-level Visual Studio releases do with the VS 2013
   Solution and Project here.

 * Determine what different and up-level Visual Studio releases do with the
   VS 2013 Solution and Project here, created by VS Express 2013 for Windows.

 * Make clear that the project uses VCShowDefs.c from the src/ folder.
