                DEFAULT SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
                ===============================================

    This folder provides a Visual Studio 2013 Project for building the
    VCShowsDef.c program.  The default settings are used for making a
    Release compilation.  No other VS 2013 settings or options are
    exercises.

    The result can be demonstrated by extracting the project, building the
    program, and executing the program using the DefaultProject.bat script.

    *** IMPORTANT ***
        The VS2013 Project and DefaultProject.bat are designed to be operated
        from working locations here.
         * DefaultRun.bat depends on DefaultProject.zip being extracted
           into subfolder DefaultProject/ of this folder.
         * The Project depends on being able to locate src/VCshowDefs.c from
           where it is extracted.

MANIFEST

    Default.txt
        This manifest, summary, and job jar.

    .gitignore
        Exclusion of DefaultProject/ from the source tree

    DefaultRun.bat
        Windows batch command script that is useful for executing the
        compiled result produced by the Default Project.

    DefaultProject.txt
        Manifest, summary and and job jar for DefaultProject.zip, describing
        how to extract and use the Visual Studio Solution and Project for the
        Default demonstration.

    DefaultProject.zip
        Zip Archive containing the Visual Studio Solution and Project that
        can be extracted in place for compiling a demonstration Default.exe
        showing default pre-processor labels that are defined (or not) in
        the compilation

    DefaultProject/
        This is a working folder in which the project files are extracted and
        used.  The working folder is not part of the Git Source Tree and its
        contents will not be preserved in the source-code control system. If
        the folder does not exist, it will be created when DefaultProject.zip
        is extracted.

TODO

 * Add the missing DefaultRun.bat script.

 * Confirm that DefaultProject.txt being the same in DefaultProject.zip
   will not produce an "uncommitted change" when extracted from the
   DefaultProject.zip archive.

 * Add DefaultProject.bat for verifying that a build has occured and then
   execute the resulting Default.exe program.

 * Verify that the Default.exe runs on Windows versions from Windows XP to
   Windows 10 Technical Preview.  It appears that it can't load on XP.

 * Verify that the VS Solution and Project work when the repository is cloned
   to a different computer location than the clone in which it was created.

 * Determine what down-level Visual Studio releases do with the VS 2013
   Solution and Project here.

 * Determine what different up-level Visual Studio releases do with the
   VS 2013 Solution and Project here, created by VS Express 2013 for Windows.

 * Make clear that the project uses VCShowDefs.c from the src/ folder.

 * Verify that Default.exe will not operate on Windows XP and see if we can
   determine exactly why.

      DefaultProject.zip is structured to depend on extraction into sub-
      folder DefaultProject/ and documented accordingly.
