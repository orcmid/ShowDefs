                   SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
                   =======================================

    This folder provides demonstrations of the connection between Visual
    Studio 2013 options and the pre-processor definitions that are made
    available in the compilation of C/C++ code.

    ShowDefs provides, by example, a clean way to include optional Visual
    Studio projects as part of a repository for a multi-platform project.
    In this approach, use of Visual Studio Solutions and Projects is
    optional and does not interfere with the other ways of producing
    builds of desktop versions to be operated on Microsoft Windows.

VS2013 VERSIONS
    Free versions of Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 are all that are required
    to employ the VS2013 Projects included in ShowDefs.  The VS Projects were
    all produced using Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop.  They have been
    tested using Visual Studio Community 2013 as well.
