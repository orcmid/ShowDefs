                   SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL STUDIO 2013 COMPILES
                   =======================================

    This folder provides demonstrations of the connection between Visual
    Studio 2013 options and the pre-processor definitions that are made
    available in the compilation of C/C++ code.

    ShowDefs provides, by example, a clean way to include optional Visual
    Studio projects as part of a repository for a multi-platform project.
    In this approach, use of Visual Studio Solutions and Projects is
    optional and does not interfere with the other ways of producing
    builds of desktop versions to be operated on Microsoft Windows.

VS2013 VERSIONS
    Free versions of Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 are all that are required
    to employ the VS2013 Projects included in ShowDefs.  The VS Projects were
    all produced using Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop.  They have been
    tested using Visual Studio Community 2013 as well.

    Information on Visual Studio Community 2013 is currently available at
    <http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs>.
    Information on the Visual Studio Express 2013 editions is available at
    <http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx>.

    Download information for all of the current free editions is available at
    <http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_2>
    It is desirable to download .iso images if possible.  These are important
    for future reinstallation, especially after the free Visual Studio 2013
    downloads are supplanted by later editions.

    Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop is much more compact, while
    Community 2013 is more comprehensive and suitable for complex projects and
    using multiple programming languages, libraries, and tools.

    Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows cannot be used with these
    solutions.  It does not support the native Desktop projects used here.

    Windows 7 and later are required for operating these versions of Visual
    Studio.

TODO

 * Add StdC/ for producing an explicitly standard compile

 * Add Stdx64/ for producing a standard x64 compilation

 * Add StdCpp/ for producing a standard C++ x64 compilation

 * Update information about obtaining and installing VS2013 in a stable place
   that is not so ephemeral as the Microsoft pages and their changing as new
   releases move to the forefront.

 * Provide information about up-level, down-level and data that applies to
   the use of all of the VS2013 Projects here.

 * Add any generic information about the use of VS2013 with the cases
   for which there are projects here.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * We need some images and related documentation here where it is common to
   all of the cases in this folder.
