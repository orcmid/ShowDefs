TODO

 * Add material to the testing folder.  The folder allows for
   multiple testing cases housed in one place.  This is different than
   tests on builds.  It is about the scripts and such here.

 * Add explanation of the testing of the <mumble>bind.bat, <mumble>bind.txt,
   and <mumble>bind.zip packagings.

 * Add explanation of the testing of the <mumble>Build.bat, <mumble>Run.bat,
   <mumble>Project.txt, and <mumble>Project.zip packages.

 * Add explanation of the testing of the Visual Studio cases.

 0.00 2014-12-27-07:45 Create initial placeholder for testing material.
      This is about common information used in testing the various scripts,
      also useful in adaptation to testing of derivatives.  This page starts
      using ShowDefs.txt 1.28 as boilerplate.
