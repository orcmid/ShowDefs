                        ===========================

    This is the common source for ShowDefs.  These files are used across
    multiple compile and test cases.

TODO

 * VCshowDefs.c: Put the location of the code in the code.  Explain that
   it is oriented to VC++ compilation.

 * Switch to an include-file structure that allows for more-systematic
   reuse in code other than simple command-line reporters.

 * VCshowDefs.c: Boil the parts down to what matters for a particular
   compiler and configuration case.

 * Explain where the defines are defined, especially for the ones tied to the
   language standards.

 * Pull out multi-platform, -configuration ones into separate little
   #include files.

 * Confirm how to get include files working when the source is included as
   existing files in a project or compile in a different directory [;<).

 * Find the example that was my original inspiration for this use of the
   pre-processor back in 2005, if not before.
