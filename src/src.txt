                        SHOWDEFS COMMON SOURCE CODE
                        ===========================

    This is the common source for ShowDefs.  These files are used across
    multiple compile and test cases.

MANIFEST

    src.txt
        This description file on the construction and organization of
        the material.

    VCshowDefs.c
        The sample program and list of defines to check in Visual C/C++
        compilations.

TODO

 * VCshowDefs.c: Put the location of the code in the code.  Explain that
   it is oriented to VC++ compilation.

 * Switch to an include-file structure that allows for more-systematic
   reuse in code other than simple command-line reporters.

 * VCshowDefs.c: Boil the parts down to what matters for a particular
   compiler and configuration case.

 * Explain where the defines are defined, especially for the ones tied to the
   language standards.

 * Pull out multi-platform, -configuration ones into separate little
   #include files.

 * Confirm how to get include files working when the source is included as
   existing files in a project or compile in a different directory [;<).
